# AI-Coding-Contrast
Comparison of various AI tools used for code generation, focusing on their strengths, weaknesses, and unique features.

## GOALS
The goals is to check AI capability base from their;

•  ```Versatility```: Excels in translating natural language to code, making it highly useful for a wide range of programming tasks.

•  ```Code Explanation```: Can explain code snippets, which is beneficial for learning and debugging.

•  ```Creativity```: Limited in generating innovative solutions as it relies heavily on existing code patterns.

•  ```Security```: Potential risk of generating insecure code if not properly supervised.
